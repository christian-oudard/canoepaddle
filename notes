Path rules.
A path is collection of segments that were all drawn with the same mode.
When you change from one mode to an incompatible mode, you start a new path.
Incompatible mode changes are any color change in a thin mode, or an
outline_color or outline_width change in a thick mode.
The rendered version of a path may have more than one svg <path> element.
Moves do not start a new path without a mode change.

Joining.
A new segment will join with the last segment in the path if it is appended to
the path and continues from the last point. If the appended segment closes the
path, it is joined with the first segment. Looped segments cannot be joined onto.

Modes
Each path has exactly one mode.
Modes are either thick or thin.
Paths having thin modes have no per-segment properties.
Paths having thick modes can have different color and width per segment.


TODO:
- OutlinedStroke mode and OutlinedFill mode 
- Do color setting into a grapefruit color object right away, not at render time.
- Implement different endcaps, such as round.
- Make offwidth and joint errors just start a new path instead? We could do
  flat cap arc joints when illegal

Tests
- test looped outlines.
- test closing a stroked path then continuing somewhere else.
